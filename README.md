# PLAYTIME

This is a repo for playing with things. 

Can include but not confined to :
- Code snippets
- Experimental code
- Random stuff
- Leetcode problems
- Project brainchilds

**Note:** The code does not mostly conforms to coding standards. This is for fast prototyping and learning.

There are no rules and the goal is to break norms, patterns, do something unconventional.

Let's have some fun!
